# HW3 Citibike Data
Team: {Cindy Y. Liu, Yuxiang Zhang}

Dateset: We use the August 2015 Citibike data because more people would use the citibike service during the warmer time period. 

External package: In order to run the code of geocoding reverse process, python geopy package needs to be installed.  Instruction: type 'pip install geopy' in command terminal to install.

Team Work:

We made the summary of the data and thought about the idea of value the inflow and outflow trips of each station. I mainly do the python programming including data mengling, using Geopy and making plots and hypothesis testing. Cindy was great with organizing the paper and gave much advice to me with coding.
