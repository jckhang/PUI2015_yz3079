## Review

1. CLARITY
The plot is easy to read, although I would hightlight the confusing points:

  (1) The 3D plot hides some of the yield curves in 2012. 

  (2) THe Y-axis does not specify the unit of maturity. The Z-axis does not specify the unit of yield.

  (3) The tick labels  of X-axis are rather sparse. If I want to specify the date of a perticular curve, I can only guess the probable date of it.

2. ESTHETIC
The colormap of the display is very interesting. I can understand that the author wants to make dark color to represents longer maturity, and we can compare treasuries with same muturity in this 3D plot easily. But I think a legend of the colormap will makes it better.

3. HONESTY
The plot seems to overall fairly represent the data. But the title of the plot does not anything about what it wants to communicate.

4. SUGGESTION
Add legend of colormap, add Y-axis units and Z-axis units and check the title.
