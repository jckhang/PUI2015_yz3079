NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

point size unexplained

labels too small

missing x label or ticks completely!

the continuous colorbar misrepresents the categories and adds to confusion

good looking at a glance, but confusing and ambiguous.



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================

=====

while the plot is pretty it is very confusing. 

the 3D does not add any information: the third axis is redundant with the blue shade. 

the axis labels are too small (and one is cut) 


the yield value for a single year cannot be read easily away from the 0 ad 30 year points. 

the structure of the data hides some datapoints (obstruction) compromising clarity and possibly honesty

============

the plot is a simple stacked histogram. 

labels are too small for readability, both tick labels and axis labels and title (which is also missing a space between word and parenthesis)

colorblind compliant

============

tick and axis labels are too small

the colors indicate the structure in the data nicely but the three shades are not distinguishable by people affected by the most common color blind variety

in general the default 3 datapoints in the legend should be substitute with a single point, as they are redundant, but in this case since the datapoints are small to allow to see the overlapping structure (presumably) the three datapoints are justified. 

10^0 should be replaced with 1, 10^1 with 10
